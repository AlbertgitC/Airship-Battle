# Airship-Battle

Link: 

### Overview
Airship Battle is a 2 players game base on classic Tank Battle game. Players take turn fire cannon with desired trajectory. If it hits other player, it depletes player's hit point. When one player's hit point reach 0, game's over.

### Functionality & MVP
- Start and reset game board
- Players take turn to move, adjust trajectory and fire cannon
- Determinant if the hit connnects, and adjust player's hit point accordingly
- Game ends when one of the player's hit point reach 0

### Technologies & Technical Challenges
This project will have the following technologies:
- JavaScript for game's logic
- Canvas API for moving objects
- Webpack to bundle files

Technical challenges:
- Fire trajectory will invole vector, and also needs to base off player's chosen angle
- Logic that determinant objects contact eachothers

### Wireframes
Airship Battle will consist of single window with game board, game control menu, links to Github and LinkedIn.

### Implementation
#### Initial Setup
Setup Node modules, webpacking necessary files. Create basic entry file.

#### Models
Setup models, write the logics base on each model's purpose.

#### Canvas
Setup canvas for moving objects.
